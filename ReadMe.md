### Air Machines
Air Machines, a new computing model for a cloud-fog-device system. 
An AM can be defined as a group of machines that are executing a given program. 
The primary difference between AM and existing systems that group large number of 
machines together to form systems (e.g., Network of Workstations (NOW)) is the
division of machines into infrastructure and non-infrastructure nodes in AM. 
The cloud and fog nodes are natural candidates for the infrastructure side. 
The non infrastructure side is composed of nodes sourced from the devices such as mobiles,
vehicles and other client-controlled (even fixed) machines.
